# SpaceX AI Assistant - Hackathon Project

## Overview

Welcome to the repository of our LLM (Language Learning Model) project, developed for a hackathon competition. Our model is built on an open-source LLM and is trained using NASA data. The primary objective of this project is to enhance the efficiency of private space companies like SpaceX by providing an AI-powered semantic search assistant.

## Objective

Astronauts currently spend 1-2 hours daily searching through paper manuals and PDFs to locate critical information. Our AI platform is designed to act as a semantic search assistant, integrated with Mission Control, to streamline various processes including communication, health monitoring, and task management. By saving an estimated 2 hours per astronaut per day at a cost of $130,000 per astronaut hour, this solution offers substantial savings for commercial space station operators.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Advanced AI-powered search capabilities to quickly find relevant information from extensive documentation.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The AI model provides contextual answers to complex queries, similar to Perplexity AI, enabling astronauts to get precise and relevant information.
- **Interactive Q&A**: The model can engage in interactive question-and-answer sessions, providing astronauts with detailed explanations and insights based on NASA data.
- **Documentation Summarization**: Summarizes lengthy documents and manuals into concise, easy-to-understand formats, saving time and improving comprehension.
